myloadbalancer
=========

This role is used to configure haproxy load balancer . Also this role solving challenge for *host ipâ€™s addition dynamically* over each Managed Node in HAProxy.cfg file.


Requirements
------------
ðŸ”† Ansible must be configured well in your controller node

ðŸ”† We must have connectivity between controller node and Managed node. You can check by command (ansible webservers -m ping) .

ðŸ”† Also make host name of servers in inventory file must be "webservers". Add all servers under "webservers" host to configure apache webservers.

ðŸ”† This role is applied after myapache role. otherwise it will be failed .Because loadbalancer does not get any running webserver.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. I used basically two variable
1. pkgs: This is used to tell which software will be install.
2. rule: This is used to create firewall rule . So we can access http and https services.

Dependencies
------------

ðŸ”† This role is dependent on myapache role(https://galaxy.ansible.com/deepaksharma2007/myapache). myapache role configure webserver and then myloadblancer register these webservers to load balancer. So we can directly access content of webserver by loadbalancer.

ðŸ”† myloadbalancer is solving challenge for *host ipâ€™s addition dynamically* over each Managed Node in HAProxy.cfg file. For this in inventory file all webserver managed node are under "webservers" host group.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: lb
      roles:
         - { role: path }
         
      here path= where you downloaded myloadbalancer
